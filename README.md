## Site Aims
This site aims to act as a platform where users can browse the products available, make purchases, receive confirmation of their orders, contact the admin, and view any upcoming events that the business may be attending. 

The website aims to be user and admin-friendly and portray a relaxing feel that's in line with the products that the site offers. 

## Target Market
When designing the website for our bath bomb and wax melt business, I carefully considered the characteristics and preferences of our target market to create a compelling user experience.

**Primary Demographic:** The primary demographic consists predominantly of women, yet it also includes individuals who share a passion for self-care and indulgence. This broad range of customers spans various age groups, encompassing children, teenagers, young adults, and middle-aged individuals, allowing us to cater to a diverse customer base.

**Focus on Self-Care:** Our target market comprises individuals who prioritise self-care, seeking stress relief and tranquility in their daily lives. Whether it's unwinding in a soothing bath or basking in the calming aroma of wax melts, these customers crave relaxation and moments of serenity.

**Interest in Natural and Eco-Friendly Products:** Their interest in natural and eco-friendly products aligns with our commitment to providing sustainable and wellness-oriented offerings.

**Gift Shoppers:** An essential segment of our target market includes gift shoppers who view our bath bombs and wax melts as thoughtful presents for their loved ones. By recognising this opportunity, we aim to emphasise the gifting aspect of our products, making them a perfect choice for special occasions.

**Online Shoppers:** Given the e-commerce nature of our business, we specifically targeted online shoppers who prefer the convenience and ease of purchasing products from their digital devices. Thus, we focused on optimizing the website for seamless navigation and an effortless checkout process, ensuring a hassle-free shopping experience.

To effectively reach and appeal to our target market, we consider marketing strategies that showcase the products' soothing and relaxing properties, highlight the use of natural ingredients, and emphasize the unique scents and designs of bath bombs and wax melts. Social media marketing, email newsletters, and engaging website content can all be valuable tools to connect with the target audience and build brand loyalty.

## E-commerce application type
This website employs a B2C (business-to-consumer) business model, meaning that our primary focus is to sell directly to our customers. To achieve this, our website will prioritize user-friendliness and accessibility, making it effortless for consumers to find and purchase our products, including the ability to view immediate prices and add directly to the bag from the products list. 

## Marketing Plan

As FizzyBeese is a small independent business the budget for marketing is limited. However, there are several ways that FizzyBeese can market itself and increase the chances of converting more customers. 

**Social Media:** To foster brand engagement and communication, our website will feature links to our social media accounts. We will run targeted ads to reach out to a wide audience tailored to our target market. I have created a mock Facebook page which you can view [here](readme/fizzy-beese-facebook.png).

**Mailing list:** Another way to gain more brand awareness is by sending regular newsletters to the mailing list obtained via the MailChimp form. The newsletter would contain information about the products we sell, updates about new products, promotions, and other relevant updates.

**Google Ads:** The use of Google ads is a great way to increase brand awareness and help with SEO. The use of Google ads can also help with the use of long-tail keywords and help with the ranking of the site.

**Influencers:** Influencers are a great way to increase brand awareness. Free samples can be sent to influencers in exchange for mentions or affiliate links. Influencers tend to have a wide reach of people that follow them, therefore, increasing our brand awareness.



#### Some extra marketing considerations to keep users on our website may include:


**Homepage Design:** The homepage will be designed to be clear, attractive, and instantly engage users. We'll prominently feature a well-defined call-to-action button upon entering the page, ensuring users understand the purpose of our site right away. The home page will also feature other things useful to both users and the admin. The admin will have the ability to show off some featured products and also the latest products that have been uploaded. The home page will also feature the business's core values, testimonials, and the address and a map to show where the store is. I feel that this will build trust with the customer and ultimately enhance sales.

**User-Friendly Navigation:** User-friendly navigation is crucial for our B2C business model. By providing an intuitive and seamless browsing experience, we aim to encourage users to spend more time on the site, ultimately leading to increased sales. Additionally, our responsive design will ensure that customers can enjoy a consistent experience across all devices, enhancing accessibility.

**Smooth Checkout Process:** The shopping cart functionality will be easy to use, allowing users to add, update, and delete items effortlessly. We'll also provide instant feedback to users as they make changes to their cart, ensuring a smooth checkout process. The users will receive a confirmation email when making a purchase and will also be able to view their past orders on their profile page.

**Customer Communication:** In order to facilitate communication with our customers, we will provide accessible contact information for store admin. This will allow users to reach out with any queries or concerns they may have, promoting a positive customer experience.



By implementing these features and functionalities, our B2C website aims to create a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience, encouraging repeat visits and capitalizing on impulse purchases.


## Agile Development

These people also tend to be interested in natural and eco-friendly products. The marketing goals for this website are to increase brand awareness, generate leads, and drive sales. The marketing strategies that will be used to achieve these goals include social media marketing, email newsletters, and engaging website content. The main goal of the website is to attract users into purchasing the products on offer.

These pages will all be accessible via the header/nav bar displayed on all the pages. Users will be able to view their account or shopping bag from their respective icons at the top of the header, displayed on every page. The products will be displayed by category, for example, bath bombs, wax melts, etc. They will also have extra filtering such as alphabetically, by price, and by fragrance type. From the products pages, you will be able to click on an individual product that will take you to view more details about a product including some more pictures of the product, product description, and the option to add it to your shopping bag.

#### Surface:

The forms on the website will be simple and easy to fill out, with clear instructions. The error messages on this website will be clear and helpful, helping users correct their mistakes.


### Following Agile Methodologies

The way that I followed agile principles was by creating a Kanban board containing all of my user stories. This kanban board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/stephenbeese/projects/6)

When starting the project I uploaded all of my user stories to the to-do section of my Kanban board.
These user stories were labeled by:
   - Must Have
   - Should Have
   - Could Have

labeling the user stories in this way allowed me to focus on which ones to prioritise when working through the project.

The way I justified these labels is as follows:
   - Must haves are absolutely crucial for an e-commerce site. For example, view cart, checkout, and payment.
   - Should have are highly desired but not crucial for the site to function as an e-commerce site. Such as filtering products and viewing order history
   - Could haves are nice to have but not at all crucial to an e-commerce application. Such as events and contact forms.

When I would get to a position where I was ready to start working on a new feature I would move the relevant user story into the in-progress section on the Kanban board and start working on it.
Once this feature was completed I would move the user story from the in-progress section to the done section allowing me to easily keep track of my progress.

## SEO considerations
### Keywords
To increase SEO I have used a keywords and description Meta tag in the head of my [base.html](templates/base.html) template. I initially wrote down as many short and long-tail keywords I could think of. I then typed some keywords into wordtracker.com to see which keywords had the highest volume (average number of searches) with the lowest competition.

With finding this balance the list of best keywords are as follows:
- scented wax melts, best scented wax melts, high scented wax melts, homemade muscle soak bath bomb, homemade bath bombs, homemade bath bombs uk, bath bomb set, Homemade toilet bombs, Toilet bombs uk, Cruelty free mens fragrance uk, Best selling bath products, Coconut bath products, Eco-friendly bath products.

I have also included some other keywords that may be less efficient but are still relevant.





### Page Titles
Each page title contains an extra title after the business name to help assist with SEO

### Robots.txt and sitemap.xml
A [sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml) and a [robots.txt](robots.txt) file have been added to the site's root to help with the site's SEO.

   - In the account dropdown menu in the navbar the admin can keep an eye on new orders by viewing the all orders page. This features a table containing relevant information about an order including:
      - Order Number
      - Date Ordered
      - Name
      - Customer Details
      - Items Ordered
      - Item Total
      - Total Weight
      - Delivery Cost
      - Grand Total
   
   - This information is everything the admin would need to ship an order. 
   - They can also view the full details by clicking on the order number to bring up the checkout success page.

![View all orders](readme/all-orders.png)

- **Hide and view hidden products**
   - The admin has the ability to hide products. For example,
      - If they are planning to release a product or a range of products on a certain day
      - They want to temporarily remove products from user viewing

![Hidden products page](readme/hidden-products-page.png)

- **View products by stock**
   - This page allows the admin to view products by stock starting with the lowest amount first. This is beneficial as the admin can easily see what products they are running low on and therefore they can easily see which ones they would have to make.

![Products by stock](readme/products-by-stock.png)

- **Add an event**
   - The admin can add an event directly from the frontend. The form has some restrictions. For example,
      - The start time cannot be before today's date
      - The end time cannot be before the start time
   If either of these conditions occur there will be a toast explaining to the user what the issue is and how to correct it.

From the admin panel, the admin has the ability to:

- **Approve testimonials**
   - The user can approve testimonials by going to the testimonial database, selecting the relevant testimonial, and clicking approve. This will then show the testimonial on the front page.

![Approve Testimonials](readme/approve-testimonials.png)

- **View messages**
   - The admin will have to use the admin panel to view the messages. They can do this by going to the contacts section. 
   - There is a boolean field that the admin can check off once they have replied to them allowing them to easily see whether they have replied yet or not. This is reflected in the string displayed when viewing the entries in the admin panel. In the form f'Message from {user}: {subject} - replied: {replied}'

These features would ideally be able to be accessed via the frontend however due to time constraints they were not able to be implemented in this way. However, the admin still has access to these features and can still act upon them.

### Future Features
<hr>

Some future features I would like to include are:

#### User Features
- **Product ratings and reviews**
   - In the future, I would like to add the ability for users to rate and review individual products.
   - This would be beneficial as the users would be able to see what other people think of the products we have on offer which will help to build trust with new customers.

- **Choose delivery or collection**
   - I would like to add the option of a user being able to collect their order if they do not want to pay for delivery.
   - Having this option could entice users to come into the shop where they are able to meet our staff and have a look around our shop. This could potentially lead to more sales by building relationships with our customers.

- **Discount codes**
   - In the future, I would like to add the inclusion of discount codes and certain long-running offers. Such as:
      - % off codes
      - Four wax bars for £10
      - Free delivery codes
      - Exclusive offers on different types of products

- **Additional payment methods**
   - I would also like to add some alternative payment methods such as:
      - Apple Pay
      - Clearpay
      - Klarna
      - Paypal
   - Having alternate payment methods such as the ones mentioned above means that the store can cater to almost anyone who wants to make a purchase.
   - Buy now pay later methods such as Clearpay and Klarna may encourage larger orders as the payments tend to be broken down across a few weeks or even months.

- **Save card information**
   - I would like to add the option of a user saving their card details so the checkout process will be even more efficient for them.

- **View past events**
   - I would also like to include the past events that the store has attended.
   - This isn't necessary however it would be nice to include to show the types of events we have done which could potentially bring up more opportunities for the future.
   - Having past events such as charity work will also help to build brand trust and show that the business has strong values and is a valued member of the local community. 

#### Admin Features
- **Approve testimonials from the frontend**
   - In the future, I would like to include the ability for the admin to approve testimonials from the front end. Removing the need for the admin to access the admin panel leaving that solely for the developer's use.

- **View contact forms in the frontend**
   - I would like to add the ability for the admin to view the messages sent by users directly in the frontend. Again, negating any use of the admin panel leaving it solely for the developers.

- **Recieve emails from contact forms**
   - I would like to add email functionality to the user contact forms where on submission the admin will receive an email with the details from the submission.
   - This would allow them to be notified and promptly respond rather than checking for messages when they can.

- **Live chat/chatbot**
   - A live chat or chatbot would be beneficial to this site. Users will be able to ask questions and receive information on products quickly and efficiently. 
   - Having this feature would hopefully convert users into customers if they weren't sure about the products the shop offers.

- **Ability to add discount codes**
   - As mentioned above I would like to add the inclusion of discount codes.
   - Having codes is a good way to try and get users to order. By running limited-time offers users may order more than normal or entice them to buy products they haven't tried before.

- **Automate nav links from product categories**
   - I would like to be able to have the navigation menu, in particular the home essentials dropdown menu, connected to the product categories database.
   - When clicked they will only show the products that are related to the relevant product category.

- **Shipping status**
   - In the order database I would like to add a field where the admin can update the shipping status of the order.
   - Once the shipping status has been updated I would like a confirmation email to be sent to the user telling them that their order is on its way.
   - This would be a useful feature for both the admin and the user to receive feedback on the status of an order.

## Testing

I have included testing details post-development in a separate document called [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

### Bugs

Below is a list of bugs that occurred during the development process, the causes of them, and how they were solved.

| Bug | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| <code>{{ MEDIA_URL }}</code> was not pathing correctly to the image source. Meaning that images were not displaying. This issue was happening in both my development environment and production environment. | The issue was that there was a missing line in my settings.py file. | Add the following line of code to the context_processors <code>'django.template.context_processors.media',</code> |
| The image and label widget on the edit product page was not showing despite following the example in the Boutique ado project. | The template was rendering the form element as a crispy form, not the custom widget. | The issue here was solved by adding an if statement into the form (lines 24 to 27 in [edit_product.html](products/templates/products/edit_product.html)) to render the custom widget instead of the crispy form field. |
Failed Build when deploying to Heroku. | Heroku failed to build due to <code>backport.zoneinfo</code> | This requirement is only needed when the Python version is below 3.9 so I added the following code to only install the package when it is required. <code>backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1;python_version<"3.9"</code> |
| I was originally using the latest version of Django (v4.2.4). Which was fine until I needed to deploy. When attempting to connect to my ElephantSQL I was unable to use the version of PostgreSQL that they have to use for free which is 11.8. | The cause of this was that the Django version I was using was only compatible with PostgreSQL version 12 and up. | The solution to this was to uninstall Django using the terminal command <code>pip3 uninstall django</code> and then install Django version 3.2 with the following command <code>pip3 install Django==3.2</code>


## Deployment

To deploy this project I used Heroku as a hosting platform with ElephantSQL as the database and I used Amazon AWS (S3 bucket) to host my static and media files.

You can view the deployment process [here](DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Credits 

This project was inspired by the Boutique Ado walkthrough project. 

In particular:
- The bag app logic
- Quantity button logic
- Mobile top header
- Product sorting functionality
- Toasts
- Stripe
- Profile app
- Deployment

To complete this project I did follow along with the walkthrough lessons provided which helped me be able to complete the features in a logical order. 
I have not directly copied and pasted these sections and they have been altered to fit this project's needs. However, the core concepts are similar to the Boutique Ado walkthrough project.

## Media
- All images are original and were taken by me during this project.
- All products are real products for a family member's business.
