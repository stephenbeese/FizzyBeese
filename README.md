## Target Market
When designing the website for our bath bomb and wax melt business, we carefully considered the characteristics and preferences of our target market to create a compelling user experience.

**Primary Demographic:** The primary demographic consists predominantly of women, yet it also includes individuals who share a passion for self-care and indulgence. This broad range of customers spans various age groups, encompassing children, teenagers, young adults, and middle-aged individuals, allowing us to cater to a diverse customer base.

**Focus on Self-Care:** Our target market comprises individuals who prioritize self-care, seeking stress relief and tranquility in their daily lives. Whether it's unwinding in a soothing bath or basking in the calming aroma of wax melts, these customers crave relaxation and moments of serenity.

**Interest in Natural and Eco-Friendly Products:** Their interest in natural and eco-friendly products aligns with our commitment to providing sustainable and wellness-oriented offerings.

**Gift Shoppers:** An essential segment of our target market includes gift shoppers who view our bath bombs and wax melts as thoughtful presents for their loved ones. By recognizing this opportunity, we aim to emphasize the gifting aspect of our products, making them a perfect choice for special occasions.

**Online Shoppers:** Given the e-commerce nature of our business, we specifically targeted online shoppers who prefer the convenience and ease of purchasing products from their digital devices. Thus, we focused on optimizing the website for seamless navigation and an effortless checkout process, ensuring a hassle-free shopping experience.

To effectively reach and appeal to our target market, we consider marketing strategies that showcase the products' soothing and relaxing properties, highlight the use of natural ingredients, and emphasize the unique scents and designs of the bath bombs and wax melts. Social media marketing, email newsletters, and engaging website content can all be valuable tools to connect with the target audience and build brand loyalty.


## Marketing Plan
This website employs a B2C (business-to-consumer) business model, meaning that our primary focus is to sell directly to our customers. To achieve this, our website will prioritize user-friendliness and accessibility, making it effortless for consumers to find and purchase our products, including the ability to view immediate prices.

**Homepage Design:** The homepage will be designed to be clear, attractive, and instantly engage users. We'll prominently feature a well-defined call-to-action button upon entering the page, ensuring users understand the purpose of our site right away.

**User-Friendly Navigation:** User-friendly navigation is crucial for our B2C business model. By providing an intuitive and seamless browsing experience, we aim to encourage users to spend more time on the site, ultimately leading to increased sales. Additionally, our responsive design will ensure that customers can enjoy a consistent experience across all devices, enhancing accessibility.

**Smooth Checkout Process:** The shopping cart functionality will be easy to use, allowing users to add and delete items effortlessly. We'll also provide instant feedback to users as they make changes to their cart, ensuring a smooth checkout process.

**Customer Communication:** In order to facilitate communication with our customers, we will provide accessible contact information for store admin. This will allow users to reach out with any queries or concerns they may have, promoting a positive customer experience.

**Brand Engagement:** To foster brand engagement and communication, our website will feature links to our social media accounts. Additionally, we'll offer the option for users to sign up for our mailing list/newsletter, allowing us to keep them informed about new products, promotions, and other relevant updates.

By implementing these features and functionalities, our B2C website aims to create a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience, encouraging repeat visits and capitalizing on impulse purchases.

## Credits 

This project was heavily inspired by the Boutique Ado walkthrough project. 

In particular:
